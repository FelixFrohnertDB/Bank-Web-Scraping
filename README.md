# Bank-Web-Scraping
This repository demonstrates my work on automating competitive analysis of banks in Germany. 
The use case is as follows: 
A regional bank with branches in several cities approaches you for advice on optimal pricing for their products. A common first step in such a pricing project is to check the products/prices of competitors within a certain radius of the bank. This involves looking at Google Maps, estimating by eye which bank in that radius might be a competitor, and checking their website for prices. This is tedious and I wanted to automate it.
The finished tool can be found in the file "excel tool". The various Python files used for web scraping can be found in utils and each is briefly explained in a corresponding Jupyter notebook.
